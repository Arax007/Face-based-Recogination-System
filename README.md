# 🚀 Face Recognition Based Attendance System

## 🎯 Overview
This project is an **AI-powered Face Recognition Based Attendance System** that automates attendance tracking using real-time face detection and recognition. It features an intuitive **Tkinter-based GUI** for seamless user interaction and employs **OpenCV** for accurate face detection. Attendance data is securely stored in **CSV files**, ensuring easy management and access.

---

## 🔥 Features
✔️ **AI-Powered Face Recognition** – Uses Haarcascade for real-time face detection.  
✔️ **Effortless User Registration** – Capture and store student images securely.  
✔️ **Automated Attendance Marking** – Recognizes faces and logs attendance with timestamps.  
✔️ **Interactive GUI** – User-friendly interface built with Tkinter.  
✔️ **Secure Access** – Password protection for new user registration.  
✔️ **Live Attendance Tracking** – Displays daily attendance in tabular format.  
✔️ **Data Storage** – Attendance records are automatically saved in CSV format.
